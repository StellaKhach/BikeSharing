The fist step of the assignment was to convert the datatype tripdurating to a date-time function so that we could see the results in minutes and hours. After this was completed, we uploaded the csv file into Tabelau and started out visualizations and analysis. After the analysis were complated, we created a story. 

The purpose of the analysis was to check who uses the bikeshare, what are the most popular days and times the bikeshare is used. We also did some comparisons to see which gender tends to use the bikes more and at what time of day.
